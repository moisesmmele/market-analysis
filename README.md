# **Job Market Analysis**

## WIP

ELT Pipeline & Dashboard with some very basic NLP techniques to generate insights 
about the tech job market (or any market, really.)

### Key features:

- **Config-Driven:** Dynamically generate insights for specific topics using definitions files, canonical mappings for providers, platforms and job levels (...or anything, really - as long as you declare it in the mappings.json file and hoist it by promoting the field as a property in listing.py)

## Tech:

- ### Python
- ### SQlite3
- ### JobSpy (Default Implementation)
- ### ...thats it i guess.
